Background:
This game starts in a simple world, where you can view each of the models you will be using in future levels (in the order you can cycle through them).

Upon a left trigger pull, you begin the first of four levels where you must collect both collectible objects, then reach the goal, without allowing the ball to hit the ground.

Bat frequency is adjusted by the blue lever, the further forward will make it swing more frequently.

Merry-Go-Round speed is adjusted by the green lever, the further forward the faster it will go!
